<h2>Visualizing Parametric Equations for the Cycloid</h2>

<h3>Play with the applet to get a feel for it.</h3>  
<ul>
<li> It is color coordinated
so that things with the same color are related.
<li> Try to figure out the  relationships.
</ul>

<h3>Set the applet as follows</h3>
<ol>
<li> Set <i>a</i> = 1 and set <i>b</i> = 1.
<br>(When <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are equal we get the <i>cycloid</i>.)
<li> Check the 'trace' box.
<li> Check the 'velocity vector' box.
</ol>
</p>

<h3>The following questions will guide you through a visual exploration of the cycloid and related curves.</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Describe a real world system that this applet models. 
<li>What is the yellow dot in your model?
<li>Notice that the radius of the wheel and the length of the blue strut
can be adjusted.
<ul>
<li> Are there values of these parameters for which the
yellow dot sometimes moves to the left? What are they?
<li>
 Are there values for which the yellow dot is sometimes stationary?
What are they?
</ul>
<li>
Select 'trace' and animate the system. 
<li>For what values of the parameters does the yellow curve cross the x-axis? 
<li>When it does cross the axis,
what is the direction of the tangent vector? Please explain.
<li>
When 'trace' is selected, a purple line is drawn. What does it
represent, in the real world system you described above?
<li>
Carry out the following vector manipulations:
<ul>
<li> Express the directed segment joining the origin to the left end of this
purple line as a vector.
<li> Express the directed segment along the purple line from the left end to
the right end as a vector. (It will depend upon theta).
<li> Express the blue segment directed from the center of the circle to the
end as a vector. (This will also depend upon theta).
<li>
Now express the position of the yellow dot as a vector-valued function
of theta.
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Exploring the cusp of the cycloid</h3>
Set the parameters <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> back to 1 and turn trace on.
<ol>
<li> Grab the circle with your mouse and drag it to the right.  
<li> The 'cusps' are the sharp points on the cycloid.  What happens
to the velocity vector at these points?
<li> Now set <i>b</i> to 3.5 and drag the circle to the right.
<br> What happened to the cusp? What happens to the velocity vector at
the bottom of the trajectory?
<li> Repeat this with <i>b</i> = .5.
</ol>

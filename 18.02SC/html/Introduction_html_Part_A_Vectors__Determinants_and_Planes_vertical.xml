  <p>Vectors are basic to this course. We will learn to manipulate them algebraically and geometrically. They will help us simplify the statements of problems and theorems and to find solutions and proofs.</p>
  <p>Determinants measure volumes and areas. They will also be important in part B when we use matrices to solve systems of equations.</p>

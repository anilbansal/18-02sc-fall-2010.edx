<h2>Visualizing the proof of Lagrange Multipliers</h2>

<h3>Play with the applet to get a feel for it.</h3>  
<ul>
<li> It is color coordinated
so that things with the same color are related.
<li> Try to figure out the  relationships.
</ul>

<h3>Set the applet as follows</h3>
<ol>
<li> Choose f(x,y) = x-y
<li> Choose g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
<li> Set xMin, xMax to -5, 5 and yMin, yMax to -5, 5.
<li> Select 'Show grad f' and 'Show grad g'
<li> Click the 'Plot curves' button.
<li> Set the <i>a</i> slider to 10 and the <i>b</i> slider to 8.
</ol>
</p>

<h3>The following will guide you through a visual explanation of why Lagrange Multipliers work.</h3>
<ol>
<li> The blue lines are the level curves for the objective function f(x,y). 
<br> The yellow circle is the constraint --our maxima and 
minima must come from points on this curve.
<li> Use the <i>a</i> slider to slowly decrease the value of <i>a</i>. 
<br>You should see a green line moving from the bottom right-hand corner 
towards the upper left-hand corner.  This is the level curve for the current
value of <i>a</i>.
<li> Stop moving the slider when the green line first touches the
yellow circle. This is the maximum value of f(x,y) on the circle.
<li> Notice that when they first touch the green line and
yellow circle are tangent. This means the vectors perpendicular to
each curve are parallel.
<li> Move the purple dot with the gradient arrows attached to the
point where the green line and yellow circle touch. 
<br>Since the
gradients of f(x,y) and g(x,y) 
are perpendicular to their respective level curves they 
will become parallel as the purple dot goes to the point of intersection.
<li> Now decrease <i>a</i> until the last point where the green line
intersects the yellow circle.  This is the minimum value of f(x,y)
on the circle.
<li> As in steps 4 and 5, you should see the gradients of f and g
are parallel (though in opposite directions) at the point of intersection.
<li> Now look at other choices of f and g and play with the applet.

<h3>Directions for Functions of Two Variables:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
 Wait for the applet to load and for the graph of the function to appear
 in the gray area above. <br>
 (If there is no gray area, check your browser settings to make sure that
 Java is enabled, or try with another browser)<p>
 <li>
 The applet combines several tools for viewing functions of two variables.
 Use the <i><b>Show</b></i> menu to switch from one mode to another.<p>
 <li>
 The applet initially starts in the <i><b>Input</b></i> mode, which lets you choose a
 function to plot (you can either enter it manually, or select one from the
 drop-down list; click on the <i>Plot</i> button to create the new plot). 
<p>
 <li>
In  <i><b>Level curves</b></i> mode (select it in the
 <i>Show</i> menu) the left half of the display shows a contour plot
 corresponding to the 3D plot in the right half. The <i><b>slider control</b></i>
 in the lower-left corner moves a level curve highlighted in yellow on both
 plots.<p>
 <li>
In <i><b>
 Partial derivatives</b></i> mode (select it in the <i>Show</i> menu)
 the right half of the display still shows the graph of the function. The
 lower-left corner shows a small contour plot, with a pink dot representing
 the point where we measure the partial derivatives. To <i><b>move the
 point</b></i>, simply click somewhere in the contour plot. 
 There are two small graphs above the contour plot: these represent
 slices of the graph of the function through the given point
 (intersecting the 3D graph with planes parallel to the <i>xz</i>- and
 <i>yz</i>-planes: compare the small plots with the highlighted curves on the 3D plot). The partial
 derivatives are, by 
 definition, the slopes of these graphs. Look at the <i><b>bottom-right</b></i> corner of
 the display for the values of <i>f<sub>x</sub></i> and <i>f<sub>y</sub></i>
 at the selected point.<p>
 <li>
In <i><b>
 Directional derivatives</b></i> mode (select it in the <i>Show</i> menu)
 the right half of the display still shows the graph of the function. The
 lower-left corner shows a small contour plot, with a pink dot representing
 the point where we measure the directional derivative. To <i><b>move the
 point</b></i>, simply click somewhere in the contour plot. 
 The  small graph above the contour plot shows a slice
  of the graph of the function through the given point by a vertical plane
that makes the angle theta with the <i<x</i>-axis (theta is controlled
by the slider). This same slice is shown on the 3D graph.
By 
 definition, the directional derivative is the slope of this graph.
Look at the <i><b>bottom-right</b></i> corner of
 the display for the values of grad f and the directional derivative.

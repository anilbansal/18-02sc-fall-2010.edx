 <li>
 Wait for the applet to load and for the contour plot to appear
 in the gray area above. <br>
 (If there is no gray area, check your browser settings to make sure that
 Java is enabled, or try with another browser)<p>
 <li>
 <b>Setup.</b> Enter the function to minimize / maximize, <i>f(x,y)</i>, into
 the box in the upper-left corner. Enter the constraint, <i>g(x,y)</i>, into
 the box immediately below. Click on the "Plot curves" button in the
 lower-left corner to update the display. Then, use the yellow slider
 control to set the value of <i>b</i> in the constraint equation
 <i>g(x,y)=b</i>.<p>
 <li>
 The applet shows a contour plot of <i>f</i> (in blue), together with the level
 curve <i>g(x,y)=b</i> corresponding to the constraint equation (in yellow).
 You can use the blue slider control to move a highlighted level curve of
 <i>f</i>. The minima and maxima of <i>f</i> subject to
 the constraint correspond to the points where this level curve becomes
 tangent to the yellow curve <i>g(x,y)=b</i>.<p>
 <li>
 Click in the contour plot to move the pink dot and display the gradient
 vectors of <i>f</i> and <i>g</i> at the given point. The components of
 grad(<i>f</i>) and grad(<i>g</i>) are
 displayed in the lower-right corner. As expected, the two
 gradient vectors are proportional to each other at a constrained
 minimum/maximum.<p>
 <li>
 The red "Show solutions" button displays a red curve consisting of all
 points where grad(<i>f</i>) and grad(<i>g</i>) are proportional to each
 other. The Lagrange multiplier method tells us that constrained
 minima/maxima occur when this proportionality condition and the constraint
 equation are both satisfied: this corresponds to the points where the red
 and yellow curves intersect.
